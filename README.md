# Task Manager Backend

This is a Django-based backend application for managing tasks. Users can securely log in to the application and add personal notes and to-do list items, with all data stored in a database.

> **Future Enhancement:** Later, I plan to integrate the Django REST framework to expose API endpoints for extended functionality and easier front-end integrations.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login system using Django's built-in auth.
- **Task Management:** Create, update, delete, and view personal notes and to-do lists.
- **Database Storage:** Persistent data storage using Djangoâ€™s ORM.
- **Planned API Integration:** Future conversion to Django REST framework for a fully RESTful API.

## Bugs
   Bug in edit task URl using id where we modify url id then see other user todo data
